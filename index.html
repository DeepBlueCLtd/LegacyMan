The mock legacy content can be found in the <code>data</code> folder.  

<ul>
  <li>The legacy welcome page is <a href="./data/Introduction/ContentsPage.html">here</a>.</li>
  <li>The bare page published from DITA_OT is <a href="./target/html/index.html">here</a>.</li>
  <li>The fancy page published from OxygenXML  is <a href="./target/oxygen/index.html">here</a>. Note:  builds of this page are triggered manually, so it may be slightly out of date</li>
</ul>
The presentation of the legacy welcome is particularly plain/ugly, but it's the text content and structure that we're working with.
