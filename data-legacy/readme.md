A previous strategy for porting legacy content was to find specific content of interest, convert it, and put it in the target document.

But, this approach didn't handle the large volume of supporting content - where we had to convert the content regardless of what it represented.  So, a new `generic` strategy was adopted.

Effort was invested in generating a large body of content that was compliant with the first strategy, but the content doesn't work for the `generic` stratgy.

The content for the first strategy is being retained in this `data-legacy` folder, in case it is of value in the future.
